                Exercise can help prevent excess weight gain or help you keep off lost weight. When you take part in physical activity, 
                you burn calories. The more intense the activity, the more calories you burn.Regular trips to the gym are great, but don't worry 
                if you can't find a large chunk of time to exercise every day. Any amount of activity is better than none.To gain the benefits of 
                exercise, just get more active throughout your day. For example, take the stairs instead of theelevator or rev up your household 
                chores. Consistency is key.Worried about heart disease? Hoping to prevent high blood pressure? No matter what your current weight 
                is, being active boosts high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the "good" cholesterol, and it decreases unhealthy 
                triglycerides. This one-two punch keeps your blood flowing smoothly, which lowers your risk of heart and blood vessel, called 
                cardiovascular, diseases.Regular exercise helps prevent or manage many health problems and concerns, including: Stroke.Metabolic 
                syndrome.High blood pressure.Type 2 diabetes.Depression.Anxiety.Many types of cancer.Arthritis.Falls.Need an emotional lift?
                 Or need to lower stress after a stressful day? A gym session or brisk walk can help. Physical activity stimulates many brain 
                 chemicals that may leave you feeling happier, more relaxed and less anxious.You also may feel better about your appearance and 
                 yourself when you exercise regularly, which can boost your confidence and improve your self-esteem.Winded by grocery shopping or
                  household chores? Regular physical activity can improve your muscle strength and boost your endurance.Exercise sends oxygen and 
                  nutrients to your tissues and helps your cardiovascular system work more efficiently. And when your heart and lung health 
                  improve, you have more energy to tackle daily chores.
